# Project Time Recorder Rails

My last personal rails project before I get my first job in Ruby on Rails.
It was useful for me to track my freelancers projects time.

## Setup Instructions

### Install the dependencies:
`bundle install`


### Setup database
`$ rails db:create`

`$ rails db:migrate`

### Run the app
`$ rails s`

### Create an user

`$ rails c`

`irb> User.create email: 'jondoe@example.com', password: '$3cr3t'`
